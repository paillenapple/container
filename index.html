					Welcome to Baltimore, Maryland, guy !<br />
					You're at the head of a dock workers team, now, and I can swear that you'll have no time to get bored !<br />
					Well... A ship's just berthed over there, anyway. Rally the troops, and get crackin' !

				<ul>
					<li>// unload all containers and try to make a maximum of money from it. //</li>
					<li>// there are four sorts of legal containers: <span class="red">red</span>, <span class="green">green</span>, <span class="blue">blue</span> and <span class="yellow">yellow</span> ones. //</li>
					<li>// you must start emptying the cargo from the above. a warning message will be displayed if you
					 click on a wrong container. //</li>
					<li>// a <span class="red">red</span> container should be removed at least every 5 containers. //</li>
					<li>// a <span class="green">green</span> container shouldn't be removed after a <span class="red">red</span> one. //</li>
					<li>// a <span class="blue">blue</span> container shouldn't be removed after another <span class="blue">blue</span> container located in the same row. //</li>
					<li>// a <span class="yellow">yellow</span> container shouldn't be removed after another <span class="yellow">yellow</span> container located in the same colum. //</li>
					<li>// in order to make more bucks, or to avoid facing a lose-big situation, you can hire up to 3
					 extra dockers. By clicking on the extra docker button, 3 randomly-selected of your containers will turn into another
					 color. //</li>
					<li>// you don't really know who extra dockers are, and they might be malicious guys. For each color conversion, there's a 20% probability that a container converts into an illegal <span class="black">black</span> container, full of smuggled goods, clothes, drugs, or even prostitutes. //</li>
					<li>// a <span class="black">black</span> container must be removed after a 4 differently-colored containers streak
					 (a <span class="red">red</span> one, a <span class="green">green</span> one,
					 a <span class="blue">blue</span> one and a <span class="yellow">yellow</span> one, whatever the order). //</li>
					<li>// if removed correctly, a legal container will make your gains increase by 10.000$. if not, your
					 gains will decrease by 30.000$. //</li>
					<li>// by removing two consecutive evenly-colored containers, gains will be multiplied by 2. by removing 3+
					 of them, gains will be multiplied by 3. //</li>
					<li>// if removed correctly, an illegal container will make your gains increase by 50.000$. if not, your
					 gains will decrease by 150.000$. //</li>
