Unload all containers and try to make a maximum of money from it.

There are four sorts of legal containers: red, green, blue and yellow ones.

You must start emptying the cargo from the above. A warning message will be displayed if you click on a wrong container.

* a red container should be removed at least every 5 containers.
* a container shouldn't be removed after a red one.
* a blue container shouldn't be removed after another blue container located in the same row.
* a yellow container shouldn't be removed after another yellow container located in the same colum.
 
In order to make more bucks, or to avoid facing a lose-big situation, you can hire up to 3 extra dockers. By clicking on the extra docker button, 3 randomly-selected of your containers will turn into another color.
You don't really know who extra dockers are, and they might be malicious guys. For each color conversion, there's a 20% probability that a container converts into an illegal black container, full of smuggled goods, clothes, drugs, or even prostitutes.
A black container must be removed after a 4 differently-colored containers streak (a red one, a green one, a blue one and a yellow one, whatever the order).

If removed correctly, a legal container will make your gains increase by _$10.000_. If not, your gains will decrease by _$30.000_.
By removing two consecutive evenly-colored containers, gains will be _multiplied by 2_. 
By removing 3+ of them, gains will be _multiplied by 3_.

If removed correctly, an illegal container will make your gains increase by _$50.000_. If not, your gains will decrease by _$150.000_.
